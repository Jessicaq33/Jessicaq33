ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Jessicaq33 

My professional experience was focused for 10 years in the field of Psychology, primarily in clinical practice. In the last 6 years, I have transitioned into content creation and editing, working as an English and Spanish content writer and editor. I also created and managed my own online mental health project named JessiTerapia, where I combined my psychology knowledge with digital communication strategies. As a part of this, I created a course on Udemy focused on anxiety management, which has successfully reached over 5,000 students to date. My psychology knowledge combined with my writing skills enables me to create meaningful content that resonates with the audience's needs.

 ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in content writing and editing roles
