👋 Hi, I’m @Jessicaq33 

My professional experience was focused for 10 years in the Psychology field, which has been mainly related to clinical practice and the content writing skills. Currently, I’m more focused on my writing skills as an English and Spanish content writer and editor. Additionally, I’m managing my own online project in Spanish named JessiTerapia and I created my own course in Udemy for anxiety management reaching so far more than 1000 students. 

Responsibility, organization and creativity are three of my favorite words. I am highly committed to my job as a writer, therefore I am always willing to learn new things to ensure the quality of my work. Currently, I am studying a course about technical writing with the aim to improve my skills. 

 👀 I’m interested in technical writing, content writing and marketing writing  
 
🌱 I’m currently learning technical writing 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on technical / content writing projects
